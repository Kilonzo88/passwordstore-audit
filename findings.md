### [S-#] Storing the password on-chain makes it visible to anyone and no longer private

**Description:**  All data stored on chain is public and visible to anyone. The `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is intended to be hidden and only accessible by the owner through the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function.
​
I show one such method of reading any data off chain below.

**Impact:** Anyone is able to read the private password, severely breaking the functionality of the protocol.

**Proof of Concept:** The below test case shows how anyone could read the password directly from the blockchain. We use foundry's cast tool to read directly from the storage of the contract, without being the owner.
Create a locally running chain

make anvil
Deploy the contract to the chain

make deploy
Run the storage tool

We use 1 because that's the storage slot of s_password in the contract.

cast storage <ADDRESS_HERE> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
You'll get an output that looks like this:

0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
You can then parse that hex to a string with:

cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
And get an output of:

myPassword
